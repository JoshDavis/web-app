	Urban Dictionary stores words and phrases that are less formal. Users create the meaning of the words and they appear dynamically.
	
	**Differences**
	
	Rather than using already created words and attaching different definitions and meanings, I am providing the user with a chance to create their very own word and definition/meaning.

## User research

This application has a pretty wide open demographic. However, I'd like to target it to young professionals and students.
As a student and young professional it's easy to get overwhelmed. What better way then to stop your work, cease a moment, and get be creative!
Many young professionals find themselves deviating from work to check Facebook. Hopefully this will be a new way to deviate and have fun.

## Similar applications

- [Intellisult] (http://intellisult.com) 

	An intelligent way to insult is the tagline of this web application.
	Basically the user types in a name and the application generates an insult to append to their name.
	
	**Differences**
	
	Rather than focus on insults; I'd like to motivate and inspire my users.
	I'd also like to make it responsive, so that it works on mobile devices.
	Users will also be able to share on Facebook and Twitter.
	
- [Gangsta Name Generator](http://gangstaname.com/)

	This application requires the user to enter a name. After submitting your name it sends back to the browser a new name, a 'Gangsta Name'.
	
	**Differences**
	
	Same idea, however, instead of retrieving a new name, I would like to retrieve something inspiring to attach to the person's name.
	I also don't want the clutter of advertisements. I want to keep it simple and fun and inspiring.

	
## User research

This application has a pretty wide open demographic. However, I'd like to target it to young professionals and students.
As a student and young professional it's easy to get overwhelmed. What better way then to stop your work, cease a moment, and get inspired!
Many young professionals find themselves deviating from work to check Facebook. Hopefully this will be a new way to deviate and inspire work productivity.

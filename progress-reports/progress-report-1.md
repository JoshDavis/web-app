#Progress Report
***
1.	In the past week I have created all the PHP files necessary for connecting with the database. I am also able to populate the database and display those entries in the browser. I’ve added some css styling to the main page just to separate entries. There will be a lot more design work to come.
2.	I believe that I have achieved my goals of creating something that works. I would like to add some more functionality to it, but I wanted to get the basics working.
3.	My goals for this week are to spend lots of time designing. I want to focus mainly on the interface and how it looks. I’d like to make it engaging and fun since I’d like to use this as a portfolio piece specifically for design. I’d like to use as much CSS3 and learn create some animations to show that I am fluent in CSS.
4.	I learned a couple of things about the process of binding values. At first I did not have the add.php  working and after receiving some help I realized what the problem was and why the index page was not fetching the data from the database.
5.	I enjoy things the most when I understand them. The more I create the PHP code and type it out myself and interact with databases the more it makes sense to me. 
6.	It was frustrating as I mentioned when I couldn’t get the index to fetch the newly added content from the database. I had to go back to our old files and skim through things and see where I went wrong. 
7.	Not really, most of the code I used is code we had used in class. My goal is just to reinforce what was learned. I am not comfortable creating anything groundbreaking at the moment. The fun part for me will be designing the interface. I want to spend more time on making the application fun and engaging.

Progress Report 2
===================

1. This past week I have accomplished implementing a css3 animation that keyframes in an about me image. I made it clickable and I am working on actually creating the about page. I've also added a lot of styling in general to the index page of my application.
2. I think I did achieve most of my goals from last week. I wanted to achieve a lot of the styling and implement the design I had initionally created as a PDF prototype. 
3. I would like to finish styling the database page where all of the submitted content is kept. Right now it is boring and doesn't really match the index page. I'd like to add some jQuery as well to make it a little more fun and dynamic.
4. I learned how to do keyframing in CSS3. I created a few animations and read some online tutorials and also implemented some different techniques. 
5. I found it enjoyable getting the animation completed on the main page. I think it really catches the eye and allows the user or future employee to be drawn into the "about me" section.
6. I am finding cross browser compatibility frustrating. For some reason the application falls apart in Opera and IE9 so I will have to work to fix those errors.
7. No.
